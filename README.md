# System One Adapter

A drop-in replacement for `typesafe_sdk`'s `system_one` evaluation API, backed by LLM
APIs instead of TypeSafe. 

Useful for comparing TypeSafe against an LLM on
cost/speed/intelligence.

## Install

The provider SDKs are optional extras — install the one(s) you use:

```bash
pip install 'system-one-adapter[openai]'      # OpenAI-compatible providers
pip install 'system-one-adapter[anthropic]'   # native Anthropic
pip install 'system-one-adapter[gemini]'      # native Gemini
```

## Usage

Unlike `TypeSafeClient`, the client is configured with how the LLM should answer, and
each call names a `provider` alongside the `model`:

```python
from system_one_adapter import SystemOneAdapterClient, Noul, Score, Choice

client = SystemOneAdapterClient(
    structured_outputs=True,  # use the provider's native structured-output mode
    llm_answer_mode="probabilities",  # or "discrete"
    normalize_probabilities=True,
)

response = client.system_one(
    state="This book was a delight to read.",
    questions={"positive": Noul(instructions="The book review is positive.")},
    provider="openai",  # "openai", "anthropic", or "gemini"
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
)
```

`provider` and `model` may also be set on the constructor as defaults. `provider`
is required unless `model` is a provider instance (e.g. a custom OpenAI-compatible
endpoint or a Gemini client):

```python
from system_one_adapter.providers.openai import OpenAIProvider

client.system_one(state, questions, model=OpenAIProvider("grok-4", base_url="https://api.x.ai/v1"))
```

Use clients as context managers (`with` / `async with`), or call `close()` /
`await aclose()` after all evaluations finish. The adapter closes providers it
creates; provider instances passed as `model` remain caller-owned.

OpenAI's endpoint uses the Responses API, with strict JSON Schema for structured
output and JSON mode for prompted output. Custom endpoints (including
`OPENAI_BASE_URL`) default to Chat Completions. Pass `api="responses"` or
`api="chat_completions"` to `OpenAIProvider` / `AsyncOpenAIProvider` to select
explicitly, for example when using an OpenAI proxy. Responses are requested with
`store=False`; corrective retries send the conversation history with each request.

Gemini uses the Interactions API. Structured mode sets `response_format` to JSON
Schema; prompted mode leaves the schema in the system prompt. Requests use
`store=False` and send the full conversation on corrective retries. Credentials
come from `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, or `api_key=` on
`GeminiProvider` / `AsyncGeminiProvider`.

For larger Anthropic evaluations, configure the output token limit on the provider
(default: 4,096 tokens):

```python
from system_one_adapter.providers.anthropic import AnthropicProvider

client.system_one(state, questions, model=AnthropicProvider("claude-haiku-4-5", max_tokens=8192))
```

`AsyncAnthropicProvider` accepts the same option. A response that reaches the limit
raises `typesafe_sdk.TypeSafeError` with instructions to increase `max_tokens` or
request fewer questions; it does not consume malformed-output retries.

Provider-declared refusals and incomplete generations, including Anthropic context
overflow, also raise `TypeSafeError` without corrective retries. The error names the
reason and preserves the full provider response in `error.debug["llm_attempts"]`.

### Reasoning effort

Reasoning depth is the main cost and latency dial on current models, so each provider
exposes it under the name its own API uses:

```python
from system_one_adapter.providers.anthropic import AnthropicProvider
from system_one_adapter.providers.gemini import GeminiProvider
from system_one_adapter.providers.openai import OpenAIProvider

client.system_one(state, questions, model=OpenAIProvider("gpt-5-mini", reasoning_effort="low"))
client.system_one(state, questions, model=GeminiProvider("gemini-3.8-flash", thinking_level="low"))
client.system_one(
    state,
    questions,
    model=AnthropicProvider("claude-sonnet-5-5", max_tokens=8192, thinking={"type": "adaptive"}, effort="low"),
)
```

The async providers accept the same options. Each is omitted from the request unless
set, leaving the model's own default, and the accepted values are whatever the installed
provider SDK accepts: `reasoning_effort` takes OpenAI's effort levels (`"none"` through
`"high"` and above), `thinking_level` takes Gemini's (`"minimal"` to `"high"`), and
`thinking` takes Anthropic's configuration object. Anthropic's `effort` is sent as
`output_config.effort`; supported levels and thinking modes vary by model.

Anthropic spends thinking from the same budget as the answer, so `max_tokens` must leave
room for both. With manual extended thinking, a `budget_tokens` at or above `max_tokens`
raises `ValueError` naming both numbers. Reasoning tokens are billed as output tokens
and counted in `response.usage.output_tokens`.

`reasoning_effort` is sent as `reasoning.effort` on the Responses API and as
`reasoning_effort` on Chat Completions, so it also reaches OpenAI-compatible endpoints
that support it.

### Response

The response is a `typesafe_sdk.SystemOneResponse` subclass — same `answers` and typed
views — with two additions:

- `response.usage` adds `input_tokens_total` / `output_tokens_total` (across retries),
  `n_retries`, `n_retries_malformed_structure`, and `latency`.
- `response.debug` holds `llm_attempts`, `retry_reasons`, and probability-normalization
  diagnostics.

OpenAI-compatible endpoints may omit token usage. Unreported counts are `None`;
the evaluation still succeeds. A cumulative token count is `None` if any attempt
omitted that count. Reported counts, including zero, are preserved.

`llm_attempts` records every provider call in order, including transient failures and
malformed responses. Each entry contains a snapshot of `messages`,
`model_request_parameters` (`schema` and `structured`), `llm_response`, and `debug_info`
with the model, provider, and any error. The built-in providers also include the exact
SDK `request` arguments, the full provider response in `llm_response`, and the API and
finish reason in `debug_info`. Custom providers return their text and token counts in
`llm_response`. Calls that fail before returning a model response leave it as `None`.
Terminal `TypeSafeError` exceptions expose the same attempt history in `error.debug`.

To replay an attempt through the same configured provider (use `await` for async):

```python
from system_one_adapter.providers import Message

attempt = response.debug["llm_attempts"][0]
result = provider.request(
    [Message(**message) for message in attempt["messages"]],
    **attempt["model_request_parameters"],
)
```

It is a Pydantic model like every SDK response in `typesafe-sdk>=0.7.0`, so use
`model_dump()` for a dictionary or `model_dump_json()` for JSON:

```python
print(response.model_dump_json())
```

### Async

`AsyncSystemOneAdapterClient` mirrors the sync client with `await client.system_one(...)`
and `async with`.

## Options

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `structured_outputs` | Use the provider's native structured output, else prompt for JSON and validate client-side (works with any chat model). |
| `llm_answer_mode` | `"probabilities"` (per-label distribution) or `"discrete"` (one value per question). |
| `normalize_probabilities` | Rescale invalid LLM probability distributions to sum to 1. |
| `n_retry_malformed_structure` | Corrective retries when the model's output fails schema validation. |
| `retry` | `typesafe_sdk.RetryPolicy` for transient provider failures. |

The transient retry count and time budget apply separately to each provider request.
Corrective requests share the evaluation's `n_retry_malformed_structure` allowance
and preserve the earlier responses and correction messages.
